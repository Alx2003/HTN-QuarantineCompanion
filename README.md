# HTN-QuarantineCompanion (HTN 2020)

## Inspiration 
Since the beginning of COVID, everyone has been stuck inside their homes
and have been bored. For Hack the North 202, we decided to create an app
that can make it much more enjoyable and you can have a little fun while
you're stuck at home or isolating.

## What it does 
Our app has Entertainment, Food, current covid cases and
worldwideemergency calling features that everyone is able to easily use.
This webapp uses Node.js, react.js, express.js, html/css/javascript and
Docker.
